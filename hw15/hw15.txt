Exercise 11: The difference between adding stuff in mem versus TextInput is that with TextInput, the response is not recorded right away and
needs to go back and change mem. Also, with mem you can choose the places in mem that the text goes, but for TextInput, it is indeterminant and
if your not careful with the design, it can overflow into other memory elements (such as the memory for a second TextInput).
