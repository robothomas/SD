The copy constructor is what is used to make a copy of one class into another class of the same type, which is mainly used for 
allocating new memory for the class that is copying and making the memory in the original identical to the memory to the class with
the new memory. The destructor is used to deallocate the memory that the class has allocated. The assignment operator is used as a link
between the two, making sure that the allocated memory for one object is not the same as the memory for the copied, second object. If this
were to be the same memory slot, the destructor would ask to deallocate the memory in the same place twice (or more), causing the memory
manager to crash the program after the attempt to deallocate memory that already was dealloacted. The assignment operator is thus the bridge
to make sure that such a request doesn't occur, and whenever memory is involved with a new class, it should create new memory through the
operator (or copy constructor, when feasible).
